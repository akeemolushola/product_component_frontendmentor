## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS properties
- CSS Grid


### What I learned

I used to refresh my memory on some semantic html tags and CSS properties, and in the cause of the project, I did make use of transform properties and media queries that i'm almost forgetting. I also make use of Grid in the project

### Continued development

I will go ahead and practice my flex and grid skils for me to be very convinient with HTML and CSS to create any layout possible
